Shopping Cart
This is a Shopping Cart application that allows shoppers to add products, view cart contents, and complete the checkout process.

Developer Story
As a developer, I want to create a Shopping Cart application with the following functionality:

Product Listing Page: Implement a page that displays a list of products available for purchase. Each product should have an "Add to Cart" button.

Session Management: Use session management to store the selected items in the cart. This ensures that the cart contents are preserved across multiple page views.

Cart Page: Build a cart page that shows the selected products, along with their quantity and total price. Allow users to adjust the quantity or remove items from the cart.

Checkout Process: Develop a checkout process that collects billing and shipping information from the user. This should include forms for the user to enter their details.

Implementation Steps
To implement the Shopping Cart application, follow these steps:

Create the product listing page with the necessary HTML/CSS structure. Include an "Add to Cart" button for each product.

Implement session management using the programming language or framework of your choice. This will allow you to store and retrieve cart information.

Build the cart page, which will display the selected products. Include options for adjusting the quantity or removing items.

Develop the checkout process, including forms for collecting billing and shipping information. Ensure proper validation and error handling.

Integrate any necessary payment gateways or third-party services for completing the purchase.

Test the application thoroughly to ensure all features are working correctly and there are no bugs or errors.

Document any installation or setup instructions in the README file, including any dependencies or specific configuration steps.

Optionally, deploy the application to a hosting platform or server so that it can be accessed by users.
